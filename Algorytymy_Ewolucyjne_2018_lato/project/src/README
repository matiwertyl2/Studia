You can evolve new cars by using:
  - Evolution.py - evolves standard neural network of fixed and regular structure
  - DagEvolution.py - evolves "neural network" that is directed acyclic graph,
                      but the structure itself can change during evolution process

In both types of evolution there is a few parameters that you should set
  - create random or some special tracks and set their lengths
  - rmin, rmax - it is the range of initial weights of edges
  - you can change the structure of standard neural network in Const.py : network_layers_shape
  - frames_limit - it is the number of ticks cars have to drive


There are number of parameters you can change in Const.py, more information
in the comments. But be careful - if you set some crazy parameters, everything will go nuts !
(ex. car width bigger than track width - how can it drive then?)

The default directories where the data will appear are set in Const.py
You can see there tracks that are currently offered to you to start evolution.

After completing evolution you can test evolved cars and collect some nice pictures
by running Aftermath.py. You only have to choose the type of evolution you have run.


Short description of files:
  AI:

    - Network - regular network + related utilities
    - DagNetwork - network of aribtrary structure + related utilities
    - Brain - decision making mechanism, takes inputs, passes through the network
              and return outputs
  Evolution:

    - Evolution - evolution of normal neural network
    - DagEvolution - evolution of directed acyclic networks
    - EvolUtils - some functions useful for further development and possible other
                  evolution methods
    - Aftermath

  Environment:

    - Geometry - set of basic object needed to create other, more interesting things
    - Car - drives, provides inputs (lengths of sensors and speed) to its brain
    - Track - the track on which cars drive. There are several options of creating tracks,
              there are also some benchmarks for testing cars.

  Simulation:

    - Simulation - creates simulation of driving cars on the given track
    - Movies - combines simulation movies and brain images to create the final content
